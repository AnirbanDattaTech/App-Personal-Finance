# PURPOSE: Summary of progress for setting up the LangGraph-based Finance Assistant

Project Goal: Implement Phase 2 of the Personal Finance App: an autonomous multi-agent Data Science Assistant using LangGraph and Gemini, integrated into a new 'Assistant' tab in the existing Streamlit application.

Current Focus (Initial Implementation):
- Set up a basic agent architecture capable of handling simple natural language queries.
- The flow involves: Classifying the query -> Generating SQL -> Executing SQL -> Generating a Plotly Chart -> Summarizing the results with text.
- Utilize Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash-latest) as the LLM.
- Integrate this agent with the Streamlit frontend via an API exposed using LangServe/FastAPI.

Key Steps Completed & Decisions Made:
1.  Requirements Updated: Confirmed requirements-v2.0.txt includes necessary libraries like langgraph, langgraph-cli, langserve, fastapi, uvicorn, langchain-google-genai, plotly, SQLAlchemy, pandas, streamlit, requests, python-dotenv, pydantic, pyyaml.
2.  Project Structure: Utilized `langgraph new finance-assistant --template=1` (minimal template) to create the standard LangGraph CLI structure within an `assistant/` directory in the main project root (`app-personal-finance/`). Agent logic resides in `assistant/finance-assistant/src/agent/`. Server configuration is in `assistant/finance-assistant/app/server.py`.
3.  Environment Setup: Confirmed GOOGLE_API_KEY needs to be present in the root .env file.
4.  Metadata: Created and refined metadata/expenses_metadata_detailed.yaml to provide detailed schema information, including category/sub-category mappings and LLM usage guidance, loaded into the graph script.
5.  Agent State (AgentState): Defined the state structure using TypedDict in src/agent/state.py, including fields for original_query, classification, sql_query, sql_results_str, sql_results_df, chart_json, final_response, and error.
6.  Graph Nodes (src/agent/graph.py): Implemented all necessary node functions:
    - classify_query_node: Classifies query using Gemini.
    - generate_sql_node: Generates SQL using Gemini and loaded metadata.
    - execute_sql_node: Executes SQL using SQLAlchemy and returns DataFrame/string.
    - generate_chart_node: Generates Plotly JSON using heuristics based on DataFrame shape.
    - generate_response_node: Generates final text summary using Gemini, handling errors/results/chart availability (used standard PromptTemplate approach after debugging chat rendering issues).
7.  Graph Edge Logic (src/agent/graph.py): Implemented the should_continue function to route graph flow based on classification and error state.
8.  Graph Compilation (src/agent/graph.py): Defined the StateGraph, added nodes and edges, and compiled it into the required 'graph' variable for LangServe.
9.  API Server (app/server.py): Configured the FastAPI server using LangServe's add_routes to expose the compiled 'graph' at the /assistant endpoint. Defined Pydantic models (AssistantInput, AssistantOutput) for the API contract. Clarified the role of FastAPI/LangServe as the backend API layer separate from the Streamlit frontend.

Current Status:
- The LangGraph agent logic (graph.py) is fully defined.
- The LangServe API server (server.py) is configured to expose the graph.

Next Steps:
1.  Implement the Streamlit 'Assistant' tab (streamlit/tabs/assistant_tab.py) with the required 2-row/2-column layout.
2.  Implement the chat interface logic within the Streamlit tab.
3.  Implement the API call (using `requests`) from Streamlit to the running LangServe backend (http://localhost:8000/assistant/invoke).
4.  Implement logic in Streamlit to parse the API response (AssistantOutput) and display the final_response (chat), chart_json (Plotly chart), and sql_results_str (table/text).
5.  Update streamlit/main.py to include the new 'Assistant' tab.
6.  Perform end-to-end testing by running `langgraph start` and `streamlit run`.
